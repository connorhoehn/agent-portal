verdict: pass
console errors: 0
layout: pass — content col left 224px w 1208px; no horizontal scroll (scrollWidth 1456 = innerWidth 1456); h1 "Agents", badge "Coming in lane P1", one EmptyState in the content column
keyboard: pass — 0 focusable controls in main (an empty state has none), Tab visited 0; the rail entry for the page is reachable by Tab from the shell
empty-state: pass — the page IS its empty state on this lane: "No agent runs yet | Each agent invocation becomes a run, with its steps and its trace as an artifact. | What comes next | Lane P1 carries the run id into every agent trace so each invocation lands here."
role-gating: pass — admin is the cross-tenant wildcard. Buttons in main: none; no Approve, Cancel, New definition or configuration control exists anywhere in the DOM of this surface (P0 surfaces are reads — those controls arrive with P2). Configuration in the rail is this role's to use; on this lane it is a read-only empty state.
notes: Lane P1 carries the AG-UI run id into every trace; until then agent invocations are not runs.
